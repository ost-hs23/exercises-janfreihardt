## What gave me joy

Writing and creating graphs.

## A task I found challenging

Working with ggplot.

## A fact I want to learn

How to prepare a panel dataset for publication.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
